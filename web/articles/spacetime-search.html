                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The role of a <i>chance</i> in our life is great.
                    It's always about finding of a <i>relevant opportunity</i>.
                    Whether it's a dream job, car, home or a partner.
                </p>
                <p class="pt-1">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, an opportunity is generally not available immediately.
                    When we don't find exactly what is needed, there are few options:
                    <li>search wider, include more sources</li>
                    <li>wait until match appears</li>
                    <li>weaken the search criteria.</li>
                </p>
                <p class="pt-1">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Every option has specific pros and cons. Using a search online means one can not
                    search wider anymore. No luck? Try again later or sacrifice your requirements.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of repeating a search again and again we usually <i>subscribe</i> to important
                sources. The problem is that to maximize the chance to catch an opportunity it's necessary to subscribe
                to nearly everything.

            <p class="pt-1">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;It's okay to filter content on the client side when you have limited number of well-known sources.
                This is how social networks, messengers, news readers, email clients use to work.
                Just follow/join to limited set of groups or channels.
                This gives you a comfortable control but with a price.
                You'll never catch any serendipitous message.
                Just because you don't know where this important message comes from.
                You remain in your limited bubble missing new things to know.
