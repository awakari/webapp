                    Today many of us want to get updates timely from the services they use: news, shops, jobs, etc.
                    But visiting every service every minute is wasting of the time.
                    One can increase the update period and do it daily.
                    Unfortunately, this means the important update is not early enough.
                    Even worse, the important update may be gone already and lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We needed this update check to be automated.
                    And this is the exact purpose of RSS.
                    No more manual visiting.
                    One's favorite feed reader does the trick and checks for updates in the background.

                        So why this didn't work?
                        The RSS support by popular services gradually decreases every year.
                        More and more services drop their RSS support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mozilla <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/feed-reader-replacements-firefox" class="text-blue-500">removed RSS support from Firefox in 2018</a>.
                        Apple <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/12/26/apple-news-no-longer-supports-rss/" class="text-blue-500">stopped providing RSS for Apple News in 2019</a>.
                        And in 2021, Google <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/16/google_groups_rss/" class="text-blue-500">removed RSS feeds from Google Groups</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason is simple: they don't want to waste their resources.
                        Consider a popular service have 1 million of their feed subscribers.
                        Let's say the approximate feed reader update period is 15 minutes.
                        Then the service has to sustain the load of about 1000 requests per second!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, consider that service actually publish updates once a day in a random time.
                        So any average reader will do 95 "dry" requests yielding no new results and only 1 is useful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So the service has to support a permanent load of 1000 RPS where about 99% of requests are waste of resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The actual <b>issue is polling</b>.
                        In the ideal world the service should push a notification to you when something happens.
                        So this should work in the reverse way.
                    </p>

            <p>
                What do services offer instead of RSS?
                They want people to allow push notifications or subscribe by email.
                The problem is that people actually hate this way.
                We'd never allow notifications from services and sites.
                We always try to avoid leaving our email for a subscription purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allowing a service to notify is the same as open the door to the hell of <b>spam</b>.
                Basically, we loose the control on what we want to receive.
                And that's why people <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28967540" class="text-blue-500">still love RSS</a>.
                Nobody wants all this spam that comes via push notifications and emails. Be honest.
