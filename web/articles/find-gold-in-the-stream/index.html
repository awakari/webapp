            Search in the Internet is finding a needle in a haystack.
            Or a gold panning when it's necessary to search in the stream.
            Thanks to Google, Bing for doing the conventional search for us.
            However, it's hardly applicable to find anything on the fly.
            How to capture a gold then?</p>

        <p class="p-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <a href="https://awakari.com/sub.html"
               class="text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-300" target="_blank">Awakari</a> is a brand-new

            service. It's capable to continuously find matches in the stream of real-time events. Consider you define
            your query once in advance. Awakari reverses the search direction. It checks every incoming message and when
            it matches your query it delivers the result to you without a delay.</p>

                <img alt="awakari river" src="rsz_dji_0926jpg.jpg" class="w-full max-w-[640px]"/>

        <p class="p-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            There's also the Awakari river in New Zealand.
            The name of the river is used to emphasize the streaming nature of the approach.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center py-2">Sources</h2>

        <p class="p-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Every river feeds from its sources and Awakari does so.
            Sources publish messages and Awakari combines everything into a single event stream.
            There are many thousands of sources at the moment of writing this article and the number is growing.
            Different types are: feeds (like RSS or Atom), social media (Fediverse), public Telegram channels, and others.

            Any user is encouraged to

               class="text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-300" target="_blank">
                add own sources</a>.
            Keep in mind there is a limit for publishing messages.
            When a user adds a source manually the source will utilize the user's publishing daily quota.
            Hence, many sources added manually by the same user will share the user's publishing quota.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center py-2">Search Alert Subscriptions</h2>

        <p class="p-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            TODO

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center py-2">Relevant Sources Discovery</h2>

        <p class="p-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            When a user subscribes for a search alert, Awakari automatically discovers globally relevant sources.
            Every new discovered source gets its own dedicated publishing quota, so it's a better way to add sources.</p>
        <p class="p-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Additionally, Awakari
            <a href="https://awakari.com/#status" class="text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-300" target="_blank">
                tracks top most useful sources</a>
            and automatically adjusts their publishing limits.
            Usefulness of the source here means how many messages from the given source have matched user interests.
            The more messages have been read from the source, the higher its publishing limit.
            Thus, in Awakari, user interests make the difference.</p>
