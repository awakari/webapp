                A conventional search, like Google, is <i>retrospective</i>.
                This means that you can find only what had happened in the past.
                Moreover, any change should be indexed first before it becomes available for a search.
                The indexing typically lasts

                    from days to weeks</a>.
                Good enough for a historical reference but always too late for important updates.</p>

            <p class="p-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The alternative approach is a

                   class="text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-300">
                    prospective search</a>.
                The purpose of this is to find something what is expected to happen in the future.
                Best to get insights, monitor mentions in the media, find a job or any other offer.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center py-2">2. Why</h2>

        <p class="p-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I want to get updates on my interests as soon as they happen.
            Whether it's a scientific discovery, breaking news or matching offers.
            My idea is that many of us would want to have the same too.</p>

        <div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 sm:space-x-4 space-y-2">

            <div>

                <p class="p-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    It's enough for a human to briefly read and understand a message for seconds or minutes.
                    So a good end-to-end delivery delay should be 1 second and the worst should be 1 minute.
                    This is quite far from what conventional search engines offer.
                    The best time period you can use is 1 hour.</p>

                <p class="p-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Moreover, you have to repeat the search again and again to get new updates.
                    This is the waste of your time. And still no guarantee you get anything matching.
                    Instead, I want to submit a query once and just wait for results.
                    A good solution should push a notification when and only when a result occurs.
                    Without any useless distractions.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="flex justify-center">
                <img src="1.jpg" class="w-[352px] border border-slate-500"/>
            </div>

        </div>

        <p class="p-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            What about feed readers and aggregators like Feedly or Inoreader?
            Reader applications automatically poll for updates and able to notify.
            However, this is not a true search because it lacks the content filtering.
            The only way to filter is to limit the sources you allow to distract you.
            Then you remain in your limited bubble missing any <i>serendipitous</i> message from the rest of the world.
            Additionally, there's no guarantee a trusted source won't feed you with a spam or other irrelevant messages.
            The client side content filtering is not feasible too.
            Just because your mobile phone can not handle a stream of messages to filter from the whole internet.
            Feeds are always a compromise between missing the important outside your bubble and distracting to tons of spam.</p>

        <p class="p-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Therefore, a true prospective search solution should resolve matching queries for every incoming message.
            After this the message may be pushed to everyone interested.
            For the notification purpose we have today some ready to use instant messaging applications.
            So I see the solution as an integration with an existing messenger.</p>

                moved to the graveyard in 2011</a>.
            There is also Google Alerts, but it's based on

                retrospective search</a>, hence, the
            <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/thread/201174003/delay-on-google-alerts-not-working-at-all"
               target="_blank" class="text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-300">
                delay is unacceptable (might be not working at all).</a>
            So the demand is still present and I don't know anything else fulfilling it.</p>

                    Based on the requirements described earlier, I implemented the Awakari service.
                    Now this is the only public live search service I know so far.
                    It's free to use, so I encourage everyone to try it.</p>

                    site, first you will see the search input.
                    You can use it for a rough test of a basic keywords query.
                    Such test query is limited by 1 hour and doesn't require any sign in.
                    When a temporary query is not enough, and you need more persistence you need to

                <p class="p-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;

                        with a Telegram account.</a>
                    The Telegram integration serves both authentication and notification purposes.
                    Awakari service itself doesn't use any user data except id to distinguish users.
                    This may be proven as far as this part is

                        Open-Source</a>.
                    In the future, it may be easily extended to deliver search results in RSS format if there's a demand.
                    Other delivery and notification options are possible too.
